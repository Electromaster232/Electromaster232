## Hi, I'm Adam!
I work on a lot of different projects across a lot of different spaces (A/V, Fundraising, Minecraft, Computer Networking, and much more).
In 2018 I founded [Endless Group](https://endlessgroup.org), a nonprofit which works to make hosting resources more accessible to everyone.
We run [AS400283](https://bgp.he.net/AS400283) and created Raisable, a web-based fundraising platform.

### My Projects
For various reasons, my most recent, coolest projects are in private repositories. Other than the public repos on my account, some of the projects I currently work on include:
* Raisable -- Java and NextJS based fundraising platform. Fully featured web dashboard with advanced emailing capabilities. Successfull in raising over $80,000 for Philadelphia charities. Cut-down version of the base Java webserver can be found [here](https://github.com/Electromaster232/java-flasklike)
* LavnerGames -- Private, custom Minecraft server built for Lavner Education
* Several custom game systems built on Valve's Source Engine

I have also written several large utility projects for Endless Group's internal operations and customers.
