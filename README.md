## Hi, I'm Adam!
I work on a lot of different projects across a lot of different spaces (A/V, Fundraising, Minecraft, Computer Networking, and much more).
In 2018 I founded [Endless Group](https://endlessgroup.org), a nonprofit which works to make hosting resources more accessible to everyone.
We run [AS400283](https://bgp.he.net/AS400283) and created Raisable, a web-based fundraising platform.

### My Projects
Some of the projects I currently work on include, but aren't limited to:
* Raisable -- Java and NextJS based fundraising platform. Fully featured web dashboard with advanced emailing capabilities. Successful in raising over $80,000 for Philadelphia charities.
  * Cut-down version of the base Java API framework can be found [here](https://github.com/Electromaster232/java-flasklike)
* LavnerGames -- Private, custom Minecraft server built for Lavner Education
* JDA-Based custom Discord bot [framework](https://github.com/Electromaster232/jda-botbase)

I have also written several large utility projects for Endless Group's internal operations and customers.
